# Results
### `results.txt`

This file contains the raw responses generated by the model. Each entry includes:

- The caption (prompt)
- The joke generated
- The generation parameters (`temperature`, `top-k`, `top-p`)
- The rating (from 0 to 4) based on subjective evaluation

## Ratings

All responses were rated manually using the following criteria:

- `0` - Incoherent, grammatically broken, too short, or unrelated to the prompt.

- `1` - Grammatically decent, but not funny or not clearly related to the prompt.

- `2` - Some potential for humor with minor grammatical issues; could be improved with more or better content.

- `3` - Funnier than a 2, with clear content and structure; may include unique approaches (e.g., dark humor or uncommon phrasing).

- `4` - Solid joke â€” decently funny and well-formed; might benefit from slight trimming or elaboration.

### `results_[number]_rating.txt`

Files like `results_4_rating.txt` contain only the jokes with the corresponding rating. These were extracted from `results.txt` using a filtering script.

### `extract.py`

This is the script used to extract the selected ratings into separate files. Beware that if used, some entries in `results.txt` may be malformed due to earlier logging issues.
